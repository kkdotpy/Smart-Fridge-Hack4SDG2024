# Smart Fridge Platform

## Overview

This project is a smart fridge platform that helps users track the items inside their fridge. The platform offers two ways to manage inventory:  
1. **Tapping items** when added or removed from the fridge.  
2. **Barcode scanning** to quickly track items.  

Additionally, the data collected is utilized to 3 applications:  
- **Chatbot:** Ask questions about your fridge's inventory and receive instant answers.  
- **Shopping List Generator:** Recommends recipes and generates a shopping list for items you don't have yet.
- **Data Visualization Dashboard:** Shows 4 main visualizations to give users an idea what they have in their fridge
